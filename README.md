# Power Core Simulator
Power Core Simulator is a simulator based off the Roblox game "Pinewood Builders Computer Core".
In this simulator, you can choose your own settings, and your options will affect the temperature!
Instead of downloading the exe, you can also run the code at [repl.it](https://replit.com/@RK26/Power-Core-Simulator#main.py)
# Future Plans
I plan to update this game in the future too, I'm very new to coding so I might have to take some time learning more advanced stuff.
# Contact
You can contact me on discord. BananaJeans#5704
# PS: False positive
You may enconter a false positive when running the exe, and currently I am working on fixing it.
