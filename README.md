# Power Core Simulator
[![Game info -  ](https://img.shields.io/badge/Game_info-_-2ea44f?style=for-the-badge&logo=python)](https://github.com/OutdatedDev/Power-Core-Simulator-/blob/main/Information.md)

Power Core Simulator is a console based game, where you can simulate the temperature of a computer core!
You can can choose whetever to enable or disable stuff, choose the amount of lasers/fans, and much more!
But things might not always go your way. Depending on if you have set the power to a unstable level, or have sabotaged it, RNG will play a role in this game!

# Future Plans
I am planning to take this game further in the future by making it a window based game so it's easier to use.
I will also be adding new features, such as continuing after temperature has been calculated, random events, etc.
But for now I'll be learning the basics of python.

# Current features
- Calculating the temperature per 8 seconds
- Special events
- Easter eggs
- Titles
