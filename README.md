# Heya! Power core simulator is a text based nuclear power core simulator. You can choose whetever to enable stuff, or not, but these things will affect the temperature of the core!
# The current temperature for a freezedown is -4000, and for a meltdown it's 4000.
# I'll be trying to update it for as long as possible so it's more fun.
# Anyways, thanks for reading this and I hope you enjoy the simulator!
