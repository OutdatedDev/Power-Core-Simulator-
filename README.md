# Power Core Simulator
Power Core Simulator is a simulator based off the Roblox game "Pinewood Builders Computer Core".
In this simulator, you can choose your own settings, and your options will affect the temperature!
# Future Plans
I plan to update this game in the future too, I'm very new to coding so I might have to take some time learning more advanced stuff.
